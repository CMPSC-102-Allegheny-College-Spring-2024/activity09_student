# Plotting : Working with code from the Matplotlib website to make plots

## Assigned: Friday, 22 March 2024

## Due: Friday, 22 March 2024, by 11am

## Reference: https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html

## Project Goals

+ To learn how to look up code for plots using the Matplotlib library.
+ To learn how to use code from tutorials
+ To to determine the difference between the types of information that plots are able to provide.

## Objectives

The objective of this assignment is to familiarize Discrete Structure students with the Matplotlib library, a powerful tool for creating visualizations in Python. By completing this assignment, students will learn how to find and implement code to create different types of plots and understand how the code works for each plot.

## Instructions

In this work, you are to select five different types of plots that capture your interest from the Matplotlib website. Find the code for each of your selected plots to run and experience. Then address the questions for each plot in the reflection document (`writing/reflection.md`). Make sure to test the code snippets provided in the tutorials to ensure your understanding. Do your best to understand the main points of the code, however, you may need to use online search engines to understand some of the finer details concerning a plot's code.

Go to the Matplotlib [website](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) showing examples of plots and the corresponding code to create the plot. There are many different types of plots available and each provides differing types of information.

Types of Plots to consider from the [examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).

+ Line Plot
+ Scatter Plot
+ Bar Plot
+ Histogram
+ Pie Chart
+ Box Plot
+ Submission Guidelines:
+ And others!

## Running your code.

Copy and paste your code into the live Jupyter notebook from the course' [website](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/).

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade.

## GatorGrade Checking

You can also use `gatorgrade` to check the baseline requirements of this assignment by running the following command in your terminal:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

If `gatorgrade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you have met baseline requirements of this project.

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

## Seeking Assistance

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
